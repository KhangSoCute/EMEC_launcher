The answer to your question depends on the type of liquid and the labware you are using to aspirate 3µl. Different aspirate modes have different advantages and disadvantages depending on these factors. For example, if you are using a 96-well plate with a low viscosity liquid, you might want to use the **Normal** mode, which is fast and simple. However, if you are using a 384-well plate with a high viscosity liquid, you might want to use the **Bottom** mode, which can reduce dead volume and ensure accurate volume control. Alternatively, if you are using a tube with an unknown liquid level or a liquid that contains solid particles or bubbles, you might want to use the **cLLD** mode, which can detect the liquid level and avoid contact with the unwanted elements.

To help you decide which mode is best for your application, you can refer to the table below, which summarizes the main features and limitations of each mode:

| Aspirate Mode | Features | Limitations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Normal | - Fast and simple <br> - Suitable for most applications <br> - No special settings required | - May leave dead volume in the well or tube <br> - May aspirate air if the liquid level is too low <br> - May contact solid particles or bubbles if present in the liquid |
| Bottom | - Aspirates from the bottom of the well or tube <br> - Reduces dead volume <br> - Ensures precise volume control <br> - Requires setting the **BottomOffset** property | - May take longer than Normal mode <br> - May not work well with low viscosity liquids <br> - May damage the tip or the labware if the bottom offset is too small |
| cLLD | - Detects the liquid level in the well or tube <br> - Aspirates from a specified distance above or below the liquid level <br> - Avoids contact with solid particles or bubbles <br> - Requires setting the **cLLDOffset** property | - May take longer than Normal mode <br> - May not work well with high viscosity liquids <br> - May not work well with transparent or reflective liquids |


According to the PDF VENUS Software Programmer’s Manual, there are three aspirate modes: Normal, Bottom, and cLLD. Here is a brief explanation of each mode and how to use them:

Normal: This is the default mode of aspirating. The pipetting channels move to the specified position, aspirate the specified volume, and then move away. This mode is suitable for most applications and does not require any special settings.
Bottom: This mode allows the pipetting channels to aspirate from the bottom of a well or a tube. This can be useful for applications that require precise volume control or minimal dead volume. To use this mode, you need to set the AspirateMode property of the Aspirate command to Bottom. You also need to specify the BottomOffset property of the command, which defines the distance from the bottom of the well or tube to the tip of the pipetting channel.
cLLD: This mode stands for capacitive Liquid Level Detection. It allows the pipetting channels to detect the liquid level in a well or a tube and aspirate from a specified distance above or below it. This can be useful for applications that require accurate liquid level detection or avoiding contact with solid particles or bubbles. To use this mode, you need to set the AspirateMode property of the Aspirate command to cLLD. You also need to specify the cLLDOffset property of the command, which defines the distance from the detected liquid level to the tip of the pipetting channel.
